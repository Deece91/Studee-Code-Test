# Studee-Code-Test

This project is a code test designed to test my skills for a junior front end engineering role, with the company Studee.

The goal of this project was to re-create a sign in page for desktop and mobile, with a focus on brand awareness, accessibilty and my coding approach.

Accessiblity
  This was a great exercise in ensuring my code is accessible to those that may have difficulties engaing with web content, to ensure the webpage was accessible to all
  I used semantic HTML elements where possible and ensured all of them had the correct ID tags and other information such as type / name and alt tags. This is
  especially useful for those utalising screen readers to engage with the web.
  
 Brand Awarenss
  While most of the brand fonts and colours were included in the design, I thought it was necessary to inlcude the Studee logo in the header of the page, this is important
  as at every stage of a user journey, we want the logo present to help with brand awarenss and brand recall. We want our users to think of us first, whenever they are discussing
  their university application progress.
  
 My Coding Approach
  I try to keep my code as clean as possible and where I can, use as little CSS as possible, you will notice I have utaliosed, what I like to call 'utility' classes such as .p-bold
  and .form-text. These are used for the elements that require similar styles to other elements throughout the document and saves time on writting code that repeats itself.
